Created variable, percent_tip, to represent the set value of the tip percentage I was given.
Created a float variable, meal, and added an input print command, "Please enter the cost of the meal: " to allow to user to input the cost of his/her meal.
Created a variable, tip, with the calculation of 'meal' multiplied by 'percent_tip' to calculate how much the user should tip.
Created a print command to add "Sub-total: $" and the 'meal' value inputted by the user earlier in the program.
Created a print command to add "Tip: $" and 'tip' to show the user the amount of money he/she should tip the worker.
Created a print command to add "Total: $" with the total of 'meal' and 'tip' to add up the total amount of money they will need to spend.
Ran the program and returned with an TypeError saying that Python couldn't convert 'float' to 'str'.
(Troubleshooting) Replaced all the +'s with commas and re-ran the program and didn't get any error.
Created an input command, "Press 'Enter' to Exit" to allow the user to kill the program.
Ran my program and tried a few example prices.
Found the decimal didn't round to two decimal places.
(Troubleshooting) Looked up how to round two decimal places in python and read a problem similar to the one I was having.
Took the comments from the post and found a print rule, "%.2f" to use that would round to two decimal places.
